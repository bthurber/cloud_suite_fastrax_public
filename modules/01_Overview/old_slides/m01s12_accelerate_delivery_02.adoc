=== Transcript


One solution for this problem is to introduce into the process a service designer who can enable self-service consumption of everything developers need. You may be familiar with this process if you have work with the Information Technology Infrastructure Library, or ITIL.

The designer obtains requirements from all stakeholders, including virtual infrastructure administrators, system administrators, and security operations. Then the designer builds the necessary configuration management content and couples it to a service catalog item. By invoking this catalog item, the environment can be deployed automatically across any number of providers, including virtualization and private or public cloud providers.
