The business environment has never been more competitive and disruptive than it is today. Businesses need to come to terms with three realities:

* *They need a continuous competitive advantage*.

Just ask Kodak, who has seen the camera business transform from a standalone device to a feature on every mobile phone, with new players like Snapfish, Shutterfly, and Chatbooks creating new ways of engaging with markets.

Bank of America is not just a bank, it is a transaction processor. Exxon Mobil is not only an oil and gas company, it is a global information systems company. With each passing day, Walgreens' business is more reliant on electronic health records.
