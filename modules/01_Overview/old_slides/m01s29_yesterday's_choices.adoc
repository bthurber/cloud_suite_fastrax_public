Alternatively, organizations could purchase an integrated solution from a vendor. The problem with this approach, up to now, has been that vendors do not provide access to open-source innovation or wrap it in proprietary code. This results in higher costs and innovation being limited to a single vendor. It also results in much higher costs and typically requires hardware be purchased and limited to the same vendor.
