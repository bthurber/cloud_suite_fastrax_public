=== Transcript

What operations really needs is a way to minimize costs and increase scale by using commodity hardware and a massively scalable distributed architecture coupled with the enterprise management features required to operate that infrastructure.  It needs a stable, tested, certified way of consuming the open source projects that make up that infrastructure. By having this, operations can deploy scale-out infrastructure in multiple locations and still aggregate management functions like chargeback, utilization, governance, and workflows into a single logical location.
