== Red Hat Cloud Suite Reporting Demo

:numbered:

== Overview

This demonstration uses CloudForms 4.0 to collect Capacity and
Utilization data from three RHEL OSP instances, each running three
instances (Windows, RHEL and Ubuntu).  The C&U data is then used to
generate utilization and chargeback reports in CloudForms.

.Goal

* Define chargeback rates

* Create reports for utilization and chargeback

.Prereqs

* None

=== Environment

The demo environment consists of the following systems:

[cols=a1,a1,a2]
|=======
|Hostname |Internal IP |Description
|`demo.cloudlab.redhat.com` |`10.0.1.10` | Jump host and Cinder/NFS server
|`cloudforms.cloudlab.redhat.com` |`10.0.1.20` | CloudForms server managing RHEL OSP Environments
|`ospny.cloudlab.redhat.com` |`10.1.0.10` | Geographically simulated RHEL OSP environment
|`osptokyo.cloudlab.redhat.com` |`10.2.0.10` | Geographically simulated RHEL OSP environment
|`ospparis.cloudlab.redhat.com` |`10.3.0.10` | Geographically simulated RHEL OSP environment
|=======

== Provision Your Demo Environment

1.  Log in to https://rhpds.redhat.com with your OPENTLC SSO credentials.
2.  Go to *Services* → *Catalogs* → *Service Catalogs*.
3.  Under *All Services* → *Red Hat Cloud Suite Demos*, select *Scalable Infrastructure Demo*.
4.  On the right, click *Order*.
5.  Read all of the information on the resulting page, check the
necessary box, and then click *Submit*.

[IMPORTANT]

It takes about 20 minutes for your demo to load completely and become
accessible, even if some of the systems are marked "Up."
You will receive an email with information about how to access your
demo environment.
The email contains a list of hostnames, IP addresses, and your GUID;
make note of them.
Whenever you see GUID in the demo instructions, replace it with the
GUID provided in the email.
You can get real-time updates of your demo environment at:

[TIP]

Be very mindful of the runtime of your demo environment! It may take you
several hours to complete the demo, so you may have to extend the
runtime. This is especially important in later steps, when you are
building the VMs. For information on how to extend runtime and lifetime,
see: https://www.opentlc.com/lifecycle

== Getting Started

1.  Open a web browser and navigate to the CloudForms appliance.  The
external hostname and IP address can be found in e-mail notification
received when the environment was ordered.

* CloudForms
Appliance: https://cloudforms-GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com

1.  Login to the CloudForms appliance:

* Username: admin
* Password: r3dh4t1!

== Instance Tagging and Enabling Capacity and Utilization

* This is already completed.  Each instance running in each
environment should already be tagged and utilization data collected.
 This can be verified by navigating to *Clouds* -> *Instances*.  Click on an
instance and *Under Smart Management*, next to *My Company Tags*, an
*Environment* tag will be assigned.  I.E. OpenStack New York.
 
* C&U is already enabled on the CloudForms appliance and no further
configuration is needed.

=== Chargeback Rates

CloudForms Management Engine provides a default set of rates for
calculating chargeback costs using a set formula based on hourly cost
per unit and hourly usage. For example, calculating the Memory Used Cost
in dollars ($) for a day can be expressed in the following ways:

* Memory allocation per hour (in MB) * Hourly Allocation cost per
megabyte * Number of Memory Allocation metrics available for the day
* Sum of Memory allocation for the day (in MB) * Hourly Allocation cost
per megabyte
* Sum of Memory allocation for the day (in MB) * Daily Allocation cost
per megabyte / 24

In a scenario where 9.29 GB of memory is used in a day with the
chargeback rate set at one dollar ($1) per megabyte per day, the Memory
Used Cost would be $396.42.

* 9.29 GB = 9514.08 MB
* 9514.08 MB * $1 (per MB per day) = $9514.08
* $9514.08 / 24 = $396.42 Memory Used Cost
